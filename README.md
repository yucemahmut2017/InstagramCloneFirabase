# InstagramCloneFirabase
In this application I tried to implement a small cloning of instagram using firebase services.

# Getting Started
To use the Cloud Storage Android SDK with Kotlin Extensions, add the following to your app's build.gradle file:


    //for Snackbar
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.3.0-alpha01'

    //for firabase
    implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:28.2.0')
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-database'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-storage'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth'


    //picasso
    implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.71828'
# firebase-storage
This is the Cloud Storage for Firebase component of the Firebase Android SDK.

Cloud Storage for Firebase is a powerful, simple, and cost-effective object storage service built for Google scale. The Firebase SDKs for Cloud Storage add Google security to file uploads and downloads for your Firebase apps, regardless of network quality. You can use our SDKs to store images, audio, video, or other user-generated content. On the server, you can use Google Cloud Storage, to access the same files.

All Gradle commands should be run from the source root (which is one level up from this folder). See the README.md in the source root for instructions on publishing/testing Firebase Storage.
